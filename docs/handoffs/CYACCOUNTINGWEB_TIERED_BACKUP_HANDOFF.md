# CYAccountingWeb — Tiered Backup Architecture Handoff

> Status: implementation handoff for the CYAccountingWeb workstream.
>
> This document does **not** authorize changes to CYAccountingWeb from the CY Web workstream. It records the agreed target architecture and migration sequence so the CYAccountingWeb conversation can implement it deliberately.

## 1. Current accepted CYAccountingWeb baseline

Read current `simonliu1118-byte/CYapps` `main` before implementation.

As of the handoff:

- CYAccountingWeb version: **V0.17.0**.
- Cloudflare D1 is the authoritative live accounting database.
- GCS production backup has completed real production acceptance.
- Existing scheduled backup time: daily 03:30 Taiwan time.
- Existing GCS retention: 14 days.
- Existing production package: `manifest.json + data.json`.
- Existing provider-neutral interface already requires `putObject`, `getObject`, `listObjects`, `deleteObject`.
- Existing GCS backup verifies read-back SHA-256, byte size, record counts and manifest compatibility.

Do **not** break or remove the accepted V0.17 GCS path while the new architecture is being introduced.

```

## 2. New target architecture

```text
Cloudflare D1
    ↓ authoritative live DB
CYAccountingWeb BackupService
    ↓ export once
portable CYBackupSet
    ├─ R2  — daily operational backup
    └─ GCS — lower-frequency cross-cloud DR replica
```

### Provider roles

**R2**

- daily operational backup;
- normal in-app restore source while Cloudflare is healthy;
- schedule: daily 03:30 Taiwan time;
- retention: 30 rolling days.

Operational infrastructure status: an Accounting-specific production R2 bucket has already been provisioned by the shared CY Web infrastructure workstream. It uses Standard storage, Asia-Pacific automatic placement, public access disabled, no Bucket Lock, and a 45-day bucket Lifecycle deletion rule as a safety guard behind the 30-day application retention policy. **Do not create a second Accounting R2 bucket.** The exact production bucket name remains in the Private operational handoff. The bucket is not yet bound to the CYAccountingWeb Worker; that binding belongs to the CYAccountingWeb migration workstream.

**GCS**

- independent cross-cloud disaster recovery;
- normal scheduled replication: Wednesday and Sunday, Taiwan local date;
- retention: 26 rolling weeks / 182 days;
- receives the exact same portable backup-set bytes as the R2 logical backup;
- must not trigger a second D1 export.

Manual / pre-restore safety backup should target both providers regardless of weekday.

## 3. Export-once requirement

One logical backup operation creates one `backupId` and one set of bytes:

```text
build data.json once
→ hash once
→ build manifest.json once
→ store/verify R2
→ store/verify same bytes on GCS when policy requires
```

Do not run `buildBackupPackage()` or an equivalent D1 export again for GCS replication.

If GCS replication fails, retry from the already-created backup set. Do not create a new payload while pretending it is the same backup event.

## 4. Shared portable backup contract

Target common outer format for CY Web and CYAccountingWeb:

```text
format = CYBackupSet
formatVersion = 1
```

Layout:

```text
<app-scope>/<backup-id>/
├─ manifest.json
└─ data.json
```

Required common manifest semantics:

```text
format
formatVersion
backupId
appId
appVersion
schemaVersion
createdAtUtc
sourceDatabaseEngine = d1
workspaceScope / tenant scope when applicable
recordCounts
totalRecordCount
dataObjectName
dataSha256
dataByteLength
```

`data.json` remains application-specific accounting data. The shared contract is the outer package/integrity contract, not a requirement that CY Web and CYAccountingWeb have identical tables.

Provider-specific copy status, bucket names, object generations, R2/GCS metadata and credentials must not be written into the portable manifest.

## 5. Compatibility with V0.17 backup format

Current V0.17 uses its accepted application-specific backup format/version. Existing GCS backups must remain readable and valid.

Therefore:

- introduce the common `CYBackupSet` format through a versioned compatibility path;
- do not rewrite old GCS objects in place;
- keep old-format validation/reader support for the accepted retention/restore compatibility window;
- only switch production output after tests prove current V0.17 backups are unaffected.

A format migration is separate from a provider migration. Do not change both destructively at the same time.

## 6. BackupStorageProvider contract

Keep the current four-operation boundary:

```text
putObject(key, bytes, metadata)
getObject(key)
listObjects(prefix)
deleteObject(key, versionToken?)
```

Normalize provider-specific metadata instead of leaking GCS/R2 details into `BackupService`.

Recommended normalized object/list fields:

```text
key
byteSize
timeCreated
versionToken?    // opaque
```

For GCS, an implementation may map `versionToken` to a generation. R2 may use no token or another opaque token. Domain code must not branch on provider-specific token semantics.

## 7. Logical backup / provider-copy catalog

Move toward one logical backup with multiple provider copies rather than one provider row pretending to be the backup identity.

Recommended semantics:

```text
backup_sets
  backup_id
  app_id
  created_at
  app_version
  schema_version
  data_sha256
  data_byte_length
  record_count
  trigger_kind

backup_copies
  backup_id
  provider
  status
  verified_at
  storage_prefix
  version_token
  last_error
```

The exact D1 schema may be adapted to existing `backup_runs`, but the business/UI behavior must be:

> one logical backup is listed once, with R2/GCS copy health beneath it.

## 8. Shared service boundary

The long-term target is:

```text
CYAccountingWeb BackupService ─┐
CY Web BackupService ──────────+→ CY Backup Service / Worker
future apps ───────────────────┘       │
                                       ├─ app-scoped R2 provider
                                       └─ app-scoped GCS provider
```

### Remains inside CYAccountingWeb

- accounting D1 export;
- accounting schema compatibility;
- accounting record-count/data validation;
- user/SUPER_ADMIN authorization;
- double-confirmation restore;
- accounting D1 restore ordering and writes;
- accounting audit evidence.

### Moves to shared CY Backup Service / Worker

- R2/GCS provider adapters;
- object storage/read-back verification;
- provider-copy catalog;
- R2→GCS replication;
- provider retention;
- retry/copy health;
- app-scoped storage routing.

The shared Backup Worker must not perform accounting D1 restore writes.

## 9. Dataset / credential isolation

Isolation remains required throughout migration.

CYAccountingWeb must have its own:

- R2 bucket/dataset binding;
- GCS bucket/dataset;
- least-privilege GCS identity/credential.

CY Web keeps separate equivalents.

When the future shared CY Backup Worker is introduced, it still uses separate app-scoped bindings/credentials. Do not replace two isolated credentials with one broad cross-application credential.

Caller identity must be mapped server-side to the allowed application dataset. A caller must not gain CY Web access merely by changing an `appId` parameter.

## 10. Migration plan — do not skip phases

### Phase A — freeze V0.17 GCS production path

Current GCS implementation remains the production safety path.

Do not remove:

- current GCS provider;
- current GCS secrets;
- current daily schedule;
- current 14-day retention behavior;

until the later acceptance gate explicitly permits cutover.

### Phase B — separate package creation from storage execution

Refactor only enough to guarantee:

```text
D1 export → BackupSet object/bytes → provider writes
```

The package builder must be callable once and reused by more than one provider.

Add compatibility tests for existing V0.17 format before switching to the common outer format.

### Phase C — add R2 in parallel

Implement `R2BackupStorageProvider` using the same provider contract and bind the **already-provisioned Accounting R2 bucket**. Do not create another bucket.

During production parallel validation:

- schedule remains daily 03:30;
- export D1 once;
- write/verify R2;
- write/verify GCS using the exact same backup-set bytes;
- GCS remains daily and retains the current 14-day policy during this phase;
- R2 application retention is 30 days; the bucket-level 45-day Lifecycle rule remains only a safety guard.

**Acceptance gate: at least 14 consecutive scheduled production backups** where both provider copies verify successfully and paired copies have the same logical backup ID and package digest.

Also test provider-specific failure isolation: a GCS copy failure must not invalidate a valid R2 copy, and an R2 copy failure must be reported distinctly.

### Phase D — enable tiered schedule

Only after Phase C acceptance:

- keep R2 daily 03:30;
- change GCS from daily backup target to Wednesday/Sunday replication;
- change GCS retention target to 26 weeks;
- GCS replication reuses the existing backup-set bytes;
- do not bulk-delete pre-cutover daily GCS objects on cutover day;
- let old daily copies age out through an explicit compatibility cleanup policy.

### Phase E — shared CY Backup Service / Worker

Do this after the tiered per-App model is stable and CY Web is ready to consume the same contract.

Migration order:

1. create shared service with app-scoped provider configuration;
2. route a non-destructive copy/verification path through it;
3. compare shared-service results with current direct App provider path;
4. move replication/retention/catalog into shared service;
5. move storage writes/reads behind private Service Binding;
6. keep direct GCS path available as rollback during acceptance;
7. only after acceptance remove direct R2/GCS bindings/credentials from the Accounting Worker.

Do not make the shared service a prerequisite for the initial R2 tier if that would delay or destabilize the accepted V0.17 production backup.

## 11. Suggested topology switch

A deployment/runtime mode is recommended so rollout is reversible:

```text
legacy_gcs
parallel_dual_provider
tiered_direct
tiered_shared_service
```

Exact variable naming is an implementation detail, but the rollout must provide an explicit rollback switch rather than requiring emergency source edits.

## 12. Retention details

Application policy:

```text
R2  30 days
GCS 182 days / 26 weeks
```

Rules:

- cleanup occurs after successful verification;
- cleanup failure is warning/follow-up, not new-backup failure;
- a source backup required for pending replication cannot be cleaned first;
- R2 bucket Lifecycle deletion is currently 45 days and is only a secondary safety guard;
- provider lifecycle must remain longer than the application policy;
- old V0.17 GCS daily backups are not destructively rewritten or mass-deleted during migration.

## 13. Restore behavior

Restore remains future/high-risk work.

Required flow:

```text
list logical backups
→ select backupId
→ prefer valid R2 copy
→ fallback to valid GCS copy
→ verify package integrity
→ verify app/schema compatibility
→ SUPER_ADMIN authorization
→ double confirmation
→ optional pre-restore backup to both providers
→ controlled D1 restore
→ reconciliation
→ audit result
```

For Cloudflare-wide disaster recovery, GCS is the independent recovery source.

## 14. Acceptance tests

Do not consider the new architecture complete until all are verified:

1. one D1 export creates one logical backup ID;
2. R2 upload/read-back SHA-256 passes;
3. GCS receives identical portable bytes for an eligible backup;
4. paired R2/GCS copy digests are identical;
5. GCS retry does not re-export D1;
6. R2 30-day retention works;
7. GCS 26-week retention works after tiered cutover;
8. cleanup failure does not invalidate a new verified copy;
9. one logical backup appears once in UI/catalog;
10. provider-copy health is visible separately;
11. R2-unavailable restore can load the valid GCS copy;
12. cross-app dataset access is rejected;
13. existing V0.17 GCS backup objects remain readable/valid;
14. rollback to current accepted GCS topology remains possible through the migration window.

## 15. Explicit instruction to the CYAccountingWeb workstream

Start by reading current `main`, especially V0.17 backup source and this handoff. Do not immediately replace the working GCS implementation.

Reuse the already-provisioned Accounting R2 bucket and implement the migration in the phases above, with V0.17 GCS kept as the accepted rollback path until the parallel 14-backup acceptance gate has passed.
